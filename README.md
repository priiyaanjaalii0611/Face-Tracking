# Face-Tracking
The project tracks the faces when the DNN model recognizes one<br>
The project takes help of our advanced computer vision and basic centroid tracking algorithm.<br>
The project can be used in many field and also can be used to track objects or cars by making few changes in the code.<br>
The model is using **DNN Face Detector in OpenCV**. It is a Caffe model which is based on the Single Shot-Multibox Detector (SSD) and uses ResNet-10 architecture as its backbone.
